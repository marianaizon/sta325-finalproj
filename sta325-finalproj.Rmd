# INDIVIDUAL PREDICTORS

## Taxi Histograms

```{r}
p00 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = TAXI_IN)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "#E81828", color = "#002D72") +
  labs(x = "Time to Taxi In",
       title = "Histogram of TAXI_IN")

p01 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = TAXI_OUT)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "#E81828", color = "#002D72") +
  labs(x = "Time to Taxi Out",
       title = "Histogram of TAXI_OUT")

grid.arrange(p00, p01, nrow = 1)
```

## Days of Month and Week

```{r}
p02 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = DAY_OF_MONTH)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#E81828", color = "#002D72") +
  labs(x = "Days of Month",
       title = "Histogram of Days of Month")

p03 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = DAY_OF_WEEK)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#E81828", color = "#002D72") +
  labs(x = "Day of Week",
       title = "Histogram of Days of Week")

grid.arrange(p00, p01, nrow = 1)
```

## Destination Locations

Origin is all JFK, but we could consider the different destination locations. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = DEST)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#E81828", color = "#002D72") +
  labs(x = "Destinations",
       title = "Bar Plot of Destinations")
```

## Depart Delay Histogram

```{r}
ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = DEP_DELAY)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 4, fill = "#E81828", color = "#002D72") +
  xlim(-25, 50) +
  labs(x = "Departure Delay",
       title = "Histogram of DEP_DELAY")
```
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = CARRIER_DELAY)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#E81828", color = "#002D72") +
  labs(title = "Carrier Delay")

p2 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = WEATHER_DELAY)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#E81828", color = "#002D72") +
  labs(title = "Weather Delay")

p3 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = NAS_DELAY)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#E81828", color = "#002D72") +
  labs(title = "NAS Delay")

p4 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = SECURITY_DELAY)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#E81828", color = "#002D72") +
  labs(title = "Security Delay")

p5 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#E81828", color = "#002D72") +
  labs(title = "Late Aircraft Delay")

grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5, nrow = 3)
```

From this EDA of the categorical variables, we probably should not perform analysis with `SECURITY_DELAY` since all of them are classified as 0. 

```{r}
flights %>%
  count(WEATHER_DELAY)
```
Furthermore, only 9 flights are classified with a weather delay, so it may not be good for our model to include this as a variable for right now. 

Overall, the categorical delay predictors I would think we could use are: Carrier Delay, NAS Delay, and Late Aircraft Delay

## RESPONSE VARIABLE: ARRIVAL DELAY TIME

I just made it a different color so that when I scroll up to look at distributions I can easily tell the response from predictors (definitely can change at the end).

```{r}
ggplot(data = flights, aes(x = ARR_DELAY)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, fill = "#002D72", color = "#E81828" ) +
  xlim(-100, 150) +
  labs(x = "Arrival Delay",
       title = "Histogram of ARR_DELAY")
```


# PREDICTORS VS RESPONSE

## ARR_DELAY and TAXI_IN / TAXI_OUT

```{r}
p6 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(y = ARR_DELAY, x = TAXI_IN)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Arrival Delay vs Taxi_In")

p7 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(y = ARR_DELAY, x = TAXI_OUT)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Arrival Delay vs Taxi_Out")

grid.arrange(p6,p7, nrow = 1)
```

These plots above suggest that we may want to transform the variables at some point. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = flights, aes(y = ARR_DELAY, x = DEST)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Destination",
       title = "Arrival Delay vs Destination")
```

## ARR_DELAY and DAY_OF_WEEK

```{r}
p8 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(y = ARR_DELAY, x = DAY_OF_WEEK)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Arrival Delay vs Day of Week")

p9 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(y = ARR_DELAY, group = DAY_OF_WEEK)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Arrival Delay vs Day of Week")

grid.arrange(p8,p9, nrow = 2)
```

## ARR_DELAY and DAY_OF_MONTH

```{r}
p10 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(y = ARR_DELAY, x = DAY_OF_MONTH)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Arrival Delay vs Day of Month")

p11 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(y = ARR_DELAY, group = DAY_OF_MONTH)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Arrival Delay vs Day of Month")

grid.arrange(p10, p11, nrow = 2)
```


# LINEAR MODELS



Variables that I think we could explore: department delay time, days of month, days of week, taxi-in, taxi-out, destination, Carrier Delay, NAS Delay, and Late Aircraft Delay.

### Full Model 

First, let's just fit a full linear model with all the variables we would like to explore. 

```{r}
full_model <- lm(ARR_DELAY ~ DAY_OF_MONTH + 
                   DAY_OF_WEEK +
                   TAXI_IN +
                   TAXI_OUT +
                   DEST +
                   DEP_DELAY +
                   CARRIER_DELAY +
                   NAS_DELAY +
                   LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY, data = flights)

summary(full_model)

```


### Select Model with AIC

```{r}
library(MASS)
step_model <- stepAIC(full_model, trace = FALSE)
summary(step_model)
```

The only variables that were removed were DAY_OF_WEEK and LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY. Let's continue using the step_model then. 

### Interactions

Because there are so many levels to Destination, I don't know if we should necessarily include an interaction with this categorical variable. My suggestion would be to find interactions with carrier_delay and nas_delay. 

```{r}
p12 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(group = CARRIER_DELAY, y = TAXI_OUT)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Carrier Delay vs. Taxi_Out", 
       x = "Carrier Delay")

p13 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(group = CARRIER_DELAY, y = TAXI_IN)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Carrier Delay vs. Taxi_In", 
       x = "Carrier Delay")

grid.arrange(p12, p13, nrow = 1)
```

```{r}
p14 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(group = NAS_DELAY, y = TAXI_OUT)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "NAS Delay vs. Taxi_Out", 
       x = "NAS Delay")

p15 <- ggplot(data = flights, aes(group = NAS_DELAY, y = TAXI_IN)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "NAS Delay vs. Taxi_In", 
       x = "NAS Delay")

grid.arrange(p14, p15, nrow = 1)
```


From what I'm seeing in the plots above, there could be an interaction between taxi_out and carrier_delay. There also seems to be an interaction between NAS delay and taxi_out as well as a possible one between NAS delay and taxi_in. Let's test these three interactions below.

```{r}
# carrier vs taxi out
interaction1 <- lm(ARR_DELAY ~ DAY_OF_MONTH + 
                   DAY_OF_WEEK +
                   TAXI_IN +
                   TAXI_OUT +
                   DEST +
                   DEP_DELAY +
                   CARRIER_DELAY +
                   NAS_DELAY +
                  CARRIER_DELAY*TAXI_OUT, data = flights)
# nas vs taxi out
interaction2 <- lm(ARR_DELAY ~ DAY_OF_MONTH + 
                   DAY_OF_WEEK +
                   TAXI_IN +
                   TAXI_OUT +
                   DEST +
                   DEP_DELAY +
                   CARRIER_DELAY +
                   NAS_DELAY +
                  NAS_DELAY*TAXI_OUT, data = flights)

# nas vs taxi in
interaction3 <- lm(ARR_DELAY ~ DAY_OF_MONTH + 
                   DAY_OF_WEEK +
                   TAXI_IN +
                   TAXI_OUT +
                   DEST +
                   DEP_DELAY +
                   CARRIER_DELAY +
                   NAS_DELAY +
                  NAS_DELAY*TAXI_IN, data = flights)

```


```{r}
anova(step_model, interaction1)
```

```{r}
anova(step_model, interaction2)
```

```{r}
anova(step_model, interaction3)
```

It actually seems that interaction3: NAS_DELAY and TAXI_IN is the only interaction that is statistically significant in predicting ARR_DELAY. Let's make this model our current model:

### Final Linear Model


```{r}
current_model <- interaction3

summary(current_model)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(current_model)
```
The diagnostic plots above suggest that this model decently satisfies the necessary conditions to assume a linear regression.
